# PUDING: Your Coding Mate 🐶✨

PUDING is a mobile app that motivates users to practice coding daily by guiding them through goal setting, solving problems, and submitting proof to earn rewards — all while keeping a virtual pet happy!

## 📌 Overview

**PUDING** is a mobile coding companion that helps users build healthy coding habits in a fun, gamified way.  
Users can set custom coding goals, solve daily problems, upload proof, and use earned coins to take care of their virtual puppy.  
The app encourages consistency through simple goal tracking and an interactive pet that reacts to the user’s progress.

## 📑 How It Works

1. **Set Your Goals:**  
   Add and manage daily coding tasks in the 'Work' tab — set the time, repetition, and problem details.

2. **Solve Problems & Submit Proof:**  
   Work on the recommended coding problems, then upload a screenshot as confirmation.  
   Each problem has a unique ID and link for easy access.

3. **Reward Your Pet:**  
   Earn coins by solving problems and spend them on food or toys for your virtual puppy.  
   The puppy’s happiness and hunger bars change dynamically based on your coding progress.
